Created a full-stack web app for a true-crime blog in order to familiarize myself with Sinatra. The app was also built with HTML, SCSS, and ActiveRecord. 

Users can sign up, submit posts, edit their profile, and view all other posts on the blog, while  clicking on the name of another user will display that user's posts. 

As of 30 April 2018 there are some functionality issues to be smoothed over, and there are CSS changes to be made. Future versions will allow comments and tags.
